## Prolog(ic) Trivia ðŸ“šðŸ”Ž

This is a Prolog implementation of a world trivia game! Players can choose one of three categories - video games, pop culture, or geography - and test their trivia knowledge! This project's GUI was developed using the XPCE library.

You can always try other categories or try to beat your high score by clicking the `Main Menu` button and choosing your category of choice!

### To Run this Game:

1. Install [SWI Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable).
2. Clone and cd into this repository.
3. Start the swipl terminal by running the `swipl` command.
4. Run the command `[trivia].` in the swipl terminal.
5. Run `main.` and the GUI will launch! 

**NOTE**: While the GUI works just fine on the Windows OS, the XPCE library does not seem to be compatibkle with the Mac OS.
